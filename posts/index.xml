      <description>Introduction The technique known as FILE structure exploitation is a technique which aims to abuse the FILE struct within libc.
This structure, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s associated set of functions, is used as a buffered input and output stream. This allows for more optimized i/o as it performs less read and writes, which allows for less context switching into the kernel.
However, if not used correctly, the FILE structure can be abused to gain various exploit primitives.</description>
