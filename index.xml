      <description>The GNU C Library is a complex library, and it&amp;rsquo;s default memory allocator PTMalloc (Posix Thread aware malloc) is no exception to this rule. Within this blog post, I will attempt to document the internals of this allocator, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s evolution throughout the years.
This post is primarily an in depth analysis and a collection of notes which I have amassed throughout the years of being bombarded with heapnote challenges.</description>
