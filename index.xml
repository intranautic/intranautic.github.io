Can you see anything?
Get a shell for me.
seethefile libc.so.6
This challenge relies on a technique known as FILE structure exploitation. I will not be covering the topic within this post, so I would recommend a read.
Arch: i386-32-little RELRO: Partial RELRO Stack: No canary found NX: NX enabled PIE: No PIE (0x8048000) We can see that there are no memory corruption mitigations enabled that seem out of the ordinary.</description>

      <description>Introduction The technique known as FILE structure exploitation is a technique which aims to abuse the FILE struct within libc.
This structure, as well as it&amp;rsquo;s associated set of functions, is used as a buffered input and output stream. This allows for more optimized i/o as it performs less read and writes, which allows for less context switching into the kernel.
However, if used incorrectly, the FILE structure can be abused to gain various exploit primitives.</description>

      <description>Hello, Iâ€™m Intranautic. ðŸ‘‹
My interests include programming, compiler theory, theoretical computer science, vulnerability research and playing CTFs.
Feel free to look around, this site is primarily a place to store and archive challenge writeups, explanations, notes on topics Iâ€™m currently researching, or just rants.</description>
